The best and simplest explanation I found on the internet is here:

- [Bitcoin 101 - Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Part 4 - Generating the Public Key (in Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB3HcPgm_FI&ab_channel=CRI)
- [Bitcoin 101 - Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Part 5 - The Magic of Signing & Verifying](https://youtu.be/U2bw_N6kQL8?si=HgtY4SnRl_SQznXD)

And the code from the videos can be found [here](https://github.com/wobine/blackboard101/blob/master/README.md). I updated both scripts to be runnable on python3 and included them in this repo.
